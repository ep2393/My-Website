    <h4> <strong> My story till now:</strong> </h4>
    <ul>
    <li>I was born in May 1993 in Chandigarh, India </li>
    <li>My undergraduate is in Electrical Engineering. However, on most days, I forget what <b> RLC circuits </b> were all about.
    Engineering was mostly about doing theatre, and building long lasting friendships, and I'm glad I invested my time in those pursuits</li>
    <li>In my first job as an analyst in McKinsey & Company, I <em> advised </em> multi billion dollar
    companies on how they could save money in IT functions</li>
    <li>My favorite part of the job at McKinsey was working on <strong>Agile, Cloud, and Effectiveness of IT surveys</strong>.
    These surveys helped me see see that a lot of money could be saved by making operations efficient (through automation) and overcoming unnecessary inertia</li>
    <li>Tired of the <em>nothing good can happen in this country</em> narrative, I decided I had to see how things worked on <em>ground</em>, and was fortunate enough to work in India's largest NGO, Pratham Education Foundation, for around 2.5 years</li>
    <li>In Pratham, I led the data collection, analysis and reporting of an in-school and in-community intervention operating across 14 Indian states</li>
    <li>Throughout both of my jobs, I was fortunate to have worked on <strong>user surveys, and data collection and reporting products.</strong> These experiences, <strong>across two very different environments,</strong> helped me understand the
      reasons behind the adoption of technology, and how it can benefit organisations and lives </li>
