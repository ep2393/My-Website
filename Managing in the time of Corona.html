		<h2> How are you managing? </h2>

		Toothbrush in hand. Toothpaste out.
		<br>
		<br>
		<em>What was this dream I had?</em>
		<br>
		An earthquake had caused the school to shut down, and miraculously, no one had gotten hurt, just like the 12 year old me had hoped. What mattered was that the school was shut, and I could watch, in peace, the Undertaker return on one channel and Tulsi's Mihir on the other.
		<br>
		<br>
		<em>Is this supposed to be a cruel joke?</em> I thought, staring at the shiny bald head I had now become used to after 3 days of gentle stroking. Couldn't be, after all, Bill Gates had warned us all of a pandemic a couple of years back, and researchers had written academic papers in 2008 post the SARS epidemic calling China's exotic meat markets 'ticking time bombs'.  Still, somehow, we ended up being in this position. This is certainly no joke.
		<br>
		<br>
		The pandemic and it's economic repercussions on the world might not be a joke, but there has been a flurry of memes and funny videos in the past 2 weeks on my phone, and at this point, I'm finding it difficult to manage the traffic. I'd downloaded Twitter to stay updated on the news, but the Nizamuddin incident created an extra variable in my mind that I didn't simply have the space for.
		<strong> In case you're wondering, here is a list of variables my mind was constantly solving for before the incident</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>How much clove should I add to the macaroni, so that it's not too spicy for my flatmate?</li>
			<li>Which online course should I take- the one on web development or the one on data science, given my future plans</li>
			<li>Wait what future plans</li>
			<li>How do I approach an exam that is a part of my future plans?</li>
			<li>If life were an exam on maintaining relationships, what would be my score? Does 'hope you are okay' really mean something?</li>
			<li>What is the slope of y = mx where y is the number of deaths, and x is the number of cases? How does this slope vary for Italy, the US and India? What could be some other graphs to represent the current Corona situation?</li>
			<li>If I light 9 diyas for 9 minutes at 9 PM, how much energy would I save?</li>
			<li>Wait why are we doing this, again? Oh because <em>we didn't have a choice</em></li>
			</ul>

		Choice is a funny thing. Our generation is the first one to have it, and unsurprisingly,
		I think we're still learning to strike the right balance of how much of it do we really want.
		At least I am. 10 years ago, if all members of my family could agree to go out for Chinese food
		on one chosen night of a month, we would consider it a victory.
		<em>But who'll split the Manchow?</em>Tough decisions, I tell you.
		<br>
		<br>
		From that to consciously choosing every single detail of your life, taking calculated risks
		that sometimes don't turn out the way you expected them to, is quite daunting.
		<br>
		<br>
		A couple of years back, to make things easier for myself, I had decided to take a hiatus from social media. I didn't have to know what was happening in Game of Thrones after all, so I never watched it, even if that meant not being able to participate in small group in after work parties. As long as I could crack poor lame jokes, and do expressions, I would be okay I thought. The only downside was that as friends moved to different countries, I couldn't manage to keep a tab on what they were doing, who they were going out with, what food they were eating,
		or what places they were visiting. Good thing that I had invested my time and energy
		in the right people in college, so they understood where I was coming from,
	  and fortunately, lowered their expectations from me.
		<br>
		<br>
		And then, Corona happened.
		<br>
		<br>
		Now I had to be updated on the latest news. Wait what, <em>I had not just stopped using social media, I had given up 'following the news!' That was a tough realization.
		When was the last time I had seriously followed an event? Damn it.</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		This was different. I didn't want to be an ignorant citizen of the world after all.
		Just to be clear, my friends still didn't expect me to change, I did.
		How could I not listen to Raghuram Rajan describing the economic consequences of the lockdown?
		Millions of people were projected to get the virus, and thousands would, as a result, die.
		<em>Should I not have this information?</em>
		I thought I should, so that I could take some action, even if it were insignificant in the grand scheme of things. I could after all, donate to the right organisations, and share requisite information with friends and family. So I get onto Twitter.

		Latest update: <em>Tom Hanks gets the coronavirus</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Mind: <em>Ignore</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Latest update: <em>Justin Trudeau's wife gets the coronavirus</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Mind:<em> Ignore</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Phone vibrates</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		A random person on a random group: <em>Hey did you hear Tom Hanks got the coronavirus?</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Fingers: <em>Yes, please send him my best regards</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Mind: <em>Wait this is not the time to be sarcastic</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Fingers: <em>Damn, that's bad news. Did you hear that Justin Trudeau's wife also got it?</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Mind: <em>Fuck that! Why is that important now? Delete whatever you typed</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Me: <em>Mute notifications</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally, me: <em>What was I doing, again? Oh yes, Twitter!</em>
		</center>
		<br>
		Coronavirus conspiracy theory;<em>well this seems interesting.
		People have been saying this was a lab experiment that blew up in China,
		and now in the world's face.</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		<em>Damn it, it's my turn to wash the utensils.</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		As soon as I'm done, I get a flurry of messages on different groups.
		<strong>How is suddenly everyone so active on their devices now?
		How are people coping so well? </strong> Oh wait, they are not, that's why they're sending videos
	  and WhatsApp forwards, but is that how one is supposed to deal with this situation?
		<br>
		<br>
		If not, then how?
		<br>
		<br>
		<em>Tee deep de deep</em>
		<br>
		<em>Tee deep de deep</em>
		<br>
		<em>Tee deep de deep</em>

		<em>Tee deep de deep</em>

		<strong>It's time for a Zoom call with colleagues, and I haven't even brushed.
		Probably need to think less from tomorrow.</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>The End. Hopefully not.</strong>
